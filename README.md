# LiquidRetina
Medical Imagery Classifier to detect Brain Tumors and Chest Cancers using the VGG-16 Convolutional Neural Network along with the SVM Algorithm.

First enhance the images you want the model trained on by running the enhance.py file.

You can also choose to augment the images by running the augment.py file before enhancing the images to increase the dataset.

Then you can train the model using the training.py file and then you can use the model using the inference.py file.
